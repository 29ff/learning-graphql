#Learning GraphQL

This repository is my attempt to learn GraphQL by going through the [official RFC specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/) and the [sample JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

The Official Specification is meant for anyone who wants to implement GraphQL core in any language. I felt the need of a simpler version that talks only JavaScript in its APIs and examples instead of being generic, so I wrote it down myself and shared with hope that others might find it useful too.
